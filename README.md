# REDMOST 

<b>RED</b>shift <b>M</b>easurement <b>O</b>f <b>S</b>pec<b>T</b>ra is a Qt6 Graphical User Interface (GUI) to do redshift measurements on 1D spectra.

If [redrock][1] is correctly installed, it cat be used as a backend to measure the redshift.

# Installation

This is a python program based on Qt6 and supports both PyQt6 and PySide6 backends.
Since it is a good practice to not mess up the system-wide python environment, you should install this program in a virtual environment. If you don't have a virtual environment yet, you can create one with the command

```python -m venv env_name```

For example, to create a virtual environment called "astro", you can use the command

```python -m venv astro```

and you can activate it with

```. astro/bin/activate```


## From this GIT repository
To install the bleeding edge version, first clone this repository
 
```
git clone https://github.com/mauritiusdadd/redmost.git
cd redmost
```

and then run pip specifying which Qt backend you want to use:

- for PyQt6: ```pip install .[pyqt6]```
- for PySide6: ```pip install .[pyside6]```

## From PyPi

just use pip, like for any other packages. Keep in mind that packaged releases may be older than the git version and could lack of some newly implemented functionalities.

- for PyQt6: ```pip install redmost[pyqt6]```
- for PySide6: ```pip install redmost[pyside6]```

After the installation, to update redmost to the most recent release, use

```pip install redmost --upgrade```

## Install third party backends

Redmost can use modular backends to measure the redshift, although only redrock is currently supported. Please check and follow the installation instructions of the single packages!

# Run

To run the program just run the command ```redmost``` in a terminal
